# PassionProjectFamilyFun
I'm big on family. I want to create an app that showcases family detail such as family trees with family photos. The user by default has the option to add and update their photos each year or as often as they like.

The Family Fun App is a mobile that allows the user to create family history and store family memories safely. The user is able to open the app, upload a photo, start a family tree, or do fun activities with the family. Recently we also added a journal portion for users to write how they feel and describe their emotions. Similarly, users are able to upload their handwritten notes and doodles. We believe this portion is valuable because we know that a picture is worth 1000 words but actual words have not lost their value. Being able to capture how someone felt in a traumatic event or a joyous occasion helps to keep the family thoughtful, sympathetic, and together.
